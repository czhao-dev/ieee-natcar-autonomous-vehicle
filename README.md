# IEEE NATCAR Autonomous Vehicle Project

An autonomous electric race car developed for the **Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) – NATCAR Competition**. Built in collaboration with a four-person team, this project showcases a complete embedded systems design cycle—from hardware integration to algorithm development—focusing on real-time navigation using sensor fusion and PID control.

## Project Overview

The IEEE North American Technical Conference on Autonomous Racecars (NATCAR) challenges teams to develop high-speed, autonomous vehicles capable of navigating complex race tracks. Our entry leveraged a combination of a line-scan camera and inductive sensors to enable accurate path following and lane detection.

### Key Features:
- Real-time line-tracing algorithm using **Arduino**
- **PID control** for smooth and precise steering
- **Sensor fusion** integrating optical and inductive data
- Stable embedded system design through intensive **debugging and optimization**
- Successfully competed in the **IEEE NATCAR Competition**

## Technologies Used

- **Arduino (C/C++)**
- **PID Control Theory**
- **Line-scan Camera**
- **Inductive Sensors**
- **Embedded Systems Debugging**

## Hardware Summary

- **Chassis:** Custom-modified RC car
